=== How to compile and manually use the GR(1) synthesis subsystem ===

NOTE: The operations described below should all be done automatically as necessary
by build.sh and SpecEditor, so it is likely you do not need to read these instructions.

--- Downloading the JTLV library ---

If it is not already present in the JTLV directory, download jtlv-prompt (NOT the plugin JAR):
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtlv/files/jar%20release/1.4.0/jtlv-prompt1.4.0.jar/download

--- To compile the JTLV subsystem ---

sh build.sh 

OR

cd GROne
javac -sourcepath . -cp ../jtlv-prompt1.4.0.jar *.java

--- To compile a specification ---

ON WINDOWS (unless using cygwin):

cd GROne
java -ea -Xmx128m -cp ../jtlv-prompt1.4.0.jar;. GROneMain [smv_file] [ltl_file]

ON OTHERS:

cd GROne
java -ea -Xmx128m -cp ../jtlv-prompt1.4.0.jar:. GROneMain [smv_file] [ltl_file]
