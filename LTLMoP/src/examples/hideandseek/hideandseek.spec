Spec: # Specification in structured English
### Overview ###
# Start in the parking lot.  If you are a seeker, stay there and count until you hear a ready whistle.
# Then search all the hiding spots until you find someone.  Once you've found someone, you are now a hider.
# If you are a hider, go back to the parking lot and wait for counting to start.
# Once that happens, go hide somewhere and whistle.

### Initialization ###

Environment starts with not hear_whistle and not hear_counting
Robot starts in Parking
# Robot can start as either seeker or hider
