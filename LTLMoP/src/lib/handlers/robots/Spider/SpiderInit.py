Some notes about the spider robot:
    Servo - ranges are about 700 to 2250, but some will hit other parts and will 
    not go the full range
            shoulder:    high -> counter clockwise motion
                         low  -> clockwise motion
            elbow:       high -> down
                         low  -> up
            wrist:       high -> in
                         low  -> out
    Legs - The legs will be referred to from 0 - 5 starting with the forward 
           right leg and moving clockwise.
           The order of the servo's index will go from shoulder to elbow to 
           wrist. Ex) leg0 shoulder is 0, leg0 wrist is 2, leg2 elbow is 7
