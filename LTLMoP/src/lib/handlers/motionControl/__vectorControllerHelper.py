	This function implements an algorithm for smooth feedback plans over convex
	cells, as described by Stephen R. Lindemann in his paper: 'Smoothly Blending
	Vector Fields for Global Robot Navigation.' The algorithm calculates the
	value of a velocity vector field at a given point.  This vector field is
	defined such that it will direct the robot from any point in the region to
	the exit face or to the map referebce point (in the last region).
	The inputs are (given in order):
		p = the current x-y position of the robot
		vert = vertices of the region, specified in clockwise order (2 x No. of vertices)
		exit = index of exit face (i.e. if the exit face is the face defined by 
			vertices 3 and 4 then exit=3). If last = 1, any exit face will do...
		last = True, if the current region is the last region
			 = False, if the current region is NOT the last region
